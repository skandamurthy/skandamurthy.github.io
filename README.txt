"""3. Create a new API that takes in a keyword, make a request to Wikipedia API (like you guys did in class) and return whatever Wikipedia API responds with."""
4. Extend the login API that you created in step 1. It should take in `username` and `password` in GET parameters. If login is successful, return `home.html`. Else, return `login_failed.html`. You can put whatever content you desire in these html files. Should work in browser.
5. (Optional) Learn how to make POST requests from browser using forms.
